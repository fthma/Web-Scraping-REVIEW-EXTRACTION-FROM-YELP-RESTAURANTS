1,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Oscar G.,5 star rating,Butcher and the Brewer is an awesome place to head for when you want to share food with friends or family.  I went here pre-Pandemic with three friends and we had an outstanding dining experience!
2,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Laura P.,5 star rating,"Nice place and interesting food and brews. Love the concept of shared plates. For 2 of us, we had the charcuterie, sliders, and the breakfast flatbread, which was the perfect amount of food and everything was delicious, especially the flatbread. The SO had a mule and I had a couple of samplers - beer was delish but didn't want to drink too much to take away from the food."
3,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Ba Chomp Ba Chomp Ba Chewy Chomp P.,5 star rating,Attended a beer event in February.

5,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Elsa C.,5 star rating,"Really impressed.  Excellent service. The atmosphere is great as well, but the food really does stand out here, while the flight was also quite good. It is highly recommended to visit, great experience! Can't wait to go back."
6,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Amy M.,4 star rating,"We had such a fun time here. My husband and I sampled all the beer. Yes- all of it. Great saisons, great lagers, great weisse. I'm not a fan of stouts or IPAs but the husband approved. Service was friendly and informative. "
7,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Susan L.,4 star rating,Such good and different food!! It's American food with a bit of a twist. The pork shank is a must try - it is so crispy and the horse radish like sauce that comes with it is very well done. 
8,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Ashley M.,5 star rating,I had a wonderful time at the Butcher and the Brewer.
9,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Lauren S.,4 star rating,"We were in Cleveland for a few days and wanted to go somewhere with friends that had something everyone could agree on. It was also within walking distance from our hotel. There was a 45 min wait when we arrived on a Monday night, prob because of the Cleveland Browns game on. We went to another bar to get a drink while waiting and got one of those buzzer things. It seemed like it was a little shorter than 45 minutes. I was in the middle of playing a game and we had to quick close out to get back here. I think they might have thought we weren't coming because when we arrived we still had to wait like 5 min for them to clear a table off."
10,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Chelsea E.,4 star rating,This one has been on my list for awhile. I finally got a chance to check it out on a fall Sunday evening with my sister and brother-in-law. 
11,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Rose K.,5 star rating,Considering butcher and brewer for a wedding rehearsal dinner. We wanted to view the venue and try the food.   
12,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Dan R.,4 star rating,"Love the way 4th Street is closed off as a pedestrian mall and transformed as vibrant Restaurant Row. The street was crowded and alive when we walked over, and after perusing the endless number of restaurant selections, we decided to put our names in at the Butcher and the Brewer."
13,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Kelli H.,2 star rating,"""Meh. I've experienced better"" literally sums up the experience at The Butcher and The Baker.  Nothing outlandishly wrong, but just nothing really right.  My husband and I went here on a recent trip to Cleveland.  I've grown up in the area, we currently live in Denver, but we are moving back soon."
14,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Mark G.,4 star rating,What a cool spot! Very industrial and steampunk looking atmosphere. Our waitress was super wonderful. She didn't once cringe at our dietary preferences (dairy and gluten free) once. 
15,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Leah L.,4 star rating,"This place was great! I ended up coming here for a girls night out and it definitely surpassed my expectations. We ordered a variety of dishes to share family-style so that we could get a little taste of everything.  Some things we ordered were patatas bravas, baked pretzel, flatbread, butcher mac and cheese, steak tartare, and bread & slather. My favorite had to be the tartare and patatas bravas.  I've never had tartare before and I was surprised I loved it.  Granted I was super hungry walking in, but I walked out of that restaurant more than stuffed because the food was excellent."
16,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Lazar V.,5 star rating,"One of my favorite places to eat in cleveland. Butcher and the Brewer is a great place to take a date or a fun place to take the family. The waiting staff is very nice. The food is amazing and the beers are great! Family style portions and a large list of brews that are all made in house. I have never had a bad time here. I recommend picking one appetizer, one protein and one vegetable option to share between 2-4 people."
17,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Melissa P.,4 star rating,I have always had a great experience here! The apps are my favorite too. The atmosphere is phenomenal with the industrial setting.
18,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Maria G.,5 star rating,Amazing! We had a quick trip to Cleveland and found this gem just a few blocks from our hotel. We weren't super hungry so we did a tapas style meal and nothing disappointed. 
19,Butcher and the Brewer,"2043 E 4th StCleveland, OH 44115",Rodolfo B.,4 star rating,"Wow... awesome place, great cocktails, menu, and service!! However, they hate broccoli, so they overcooked it.... more about that later!!  Shame on them!! Stopped by after some cocktails.... restaurant had special menu during restaurant week... again, delish.  I will return cause it's so hip!! But will sub the broccoli!!"
0,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Linda N.,5 star rating,While in Cleveland for a weekend visit I checked Yelp to find some good food and this place came up and caught my eye. I called to confirm if they were open and yes they were so we jumped in the car and took the 10 minute drive from our downtown hotel. 
1,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Julian F.,4 star rating,"This restaurant has been on my ""must try"" list for quite a while now so tonight we decided to make the trip and give it a try, and boy were we happy. We arrived without a reservation and after the two hostesses talked to each other about who's section was open and to fulfill our request of a booth, we were seated promptly. We noticed several social distancing implementations including plexiglass dividers in-between seats at the bar. Everything was clean and appeared sanitized and all employees and customers we saw wore masks as required by Ohio mandate."
2,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Melissa J.,4 star rating,"Always a great meal!  Brunch, happy hour or dinner, great service and food always on the menu at The Bourbon Street Barrel Room.  "
3,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Dana H.,5 star rating,"What a fun yummy taste of the Big Easy! There were so many great things about this place. From the happy hour that goes till 7, to the super friendly and helpful staff, and not to mention...the food!! I haven't had gumbo this good since being in New Orleans! Such great escape from the normal run of the mill places!!"
4,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Sarah J.,5 star rating,"We went to BSBR last night and it was packed! But I can tell you why. The environment is straight out of Louisiana, Cool, chili, dim lit and beautiful. But the food! My fiancé LOVES the jambalaya with shrimp creole. We always get the hush puppies with the amazing sauce. And this time I got the ratatouille with chicken. So good. Great flavors. Quality food. Great drinks too!! Love this place! And it's 2 stories, fun!"
5,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Michael G.,5 star rating,Awesome restaurant. Unique foods. Definitely a place i need to revisit. The atmosphere is lively with lots of distractions.  Decor is excellent.  Staff is nice however our waitress stated she doesn't drink and couldnt provide any Information about the drinks.  The drinks we did end up ordering were great though.  Very pleased.  Will be back!
6,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Rose K.,5 star rating,Came here after the winter warmer beer fest.   The food was excellent and the service by Justin was awesome.  
7,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Bob C.,5 star rating,What a wonderful taste of Nola in Cleveland. It was a Sunday an the browns AND the tribe had lost so I went to cheer up with some Cajun yummies. The waitress called me and my wife hon and I thought that was delightful. My old fashioned was very good and her zombie could've made any man rise from the dead. The seafood gumbo and catfish dinner were some of the best I've ever had and I have actually been to New Orleans I was there last time in May of 2015. My uncle in law called Cleveland the mistake on the lake but I really loved this place and give it a score of 11/10 :)
8,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Rebecca L.,5 star rating,"Okay Yelp, 5 stars is just not enough for Bourbon Street Barrel Room! My hubby and I stopped in on a Friday night for his birthday dinner. The decor instantly drew me in - the colorful walls, patterned ceilings, large chandelier, and lanterns made the Barrel Room absolutely charming!"
9,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Mary D.,4 star rating,"I'm not a huge cajun/creole fan, but every once in a while it's fun, and The Bourbon Street Barrel Room certainly made it fun! "
10,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Jennifer D.,2 star rating,It was a very poor rendition of NOLA style cuisine and totally overpriced for entrees Anyone can make at home. The crawfish etoufee shame on them for charging $20 for this dish. See photo. NOLA cuisine is meant to be well seasoned and these days we all love the heat. So why they made it so bland and totally overpowered by canned tomatoes is beyond explaining.
11,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Jen S.,2 star rating,This place has all the potential with none of the follow through. The setting is gorgeous with chandeliers and copper ceilings but the service and food does not deliver. 
12,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Traveling A.,4 star rating,"The scene definitely as active and was a great resemblance of the south, plus we were lucky to sit upstairs that overlooked the downstairs. And yes - there were beads dangling from the indoor balcony."
13,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Jasmine B.,5 star rating,"Oh My Gosh! This place is absolutely amazing! The service, the food, the portions, and price made our 45 minute wait truly worth it. The portions were great for the amount we paid and were fulfilling, I was even able to box up my food and finish it at the hotel because I had an abundance of pasta left. The service was quick and for a large party of 15 I was very pleased with the ease of getting our meals, and hot which is sometimes rare with such a huge party. For the price paid I was very pleased with how much food was received. Lastly the food was very good and the beignets after were such a nice desert taste! Everything was hot and tasted so fresh. I am definitely pleased with everything!"
14,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Amanda M.,5 star rating,Just like New Orleans 
15,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Cameron Q.,3 star rating,"I got the fresh blackened catfish meunière with white rice. The rice cooked very well but the flavor of the dish didn't really stand out for me. I feel like they could enhance more flavors to the sauce more.  I also got gator bites for appetizers. The gators tasted like chicken but the breading did not complement the dish well. Moreover, their jambalaya was good but then again I felt short with the sauce as well. Nonetheless, their cocktails were super delicious though. Overall, good food and nice ambience"
16,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Grant E.,5 star rating,"Feel like a night in the big easy, but realizing your in Cleveland... Bourbon Street Barrel Room is 100% committed to bring the New Orleans vibes. From the old school French style decor, to the music, and the menu they deliver on all aspects. A huge plus for this restaurant is that they always have a special going on be it happy hour or daily specials. Starting off with make your own old fashioned was a new concept to me that was fantastic. For food I got the fleur debris poboy which was basically a pot roast sandwich perfectly topped with a horseradish sauce and some veg. Pro tip: they will allow for you to sub your side for a cup of gumbo and this always needs to be the move. Probably the best part of the meal was the gumbo as it was so rich and creamy with the perfect about of Nola spice. Will definitely be returning here for another trip to the big easy."
17,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Michael B.,5 star rating,"So glad to see this Tremont gem reopen.  I had to walk over, belly up to the bar and celebrate their reopening with a delicious beer, bowl of gumbo and some hush puppies.  All fantastic - and the service was great as well."
18,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Greg E.,4 star rating,"Atmosphere - awesome! This NOLA styled restaurant is huge! With seating for over 200 on two floors as well as a patio seating area and a huge bar, the place has a classy Bourbon Street party feel. "
19,The Bourbon Street Barrel Room,"2393 Professor AveCleveland, OH 44113",Beth E.,3 star rating,"First time customers to this interesting restaurant.   We have been to New Orleans dozens of time and enjoy the food, so we were ready to eat here.   The restaurant is located in a beautiful neighborhood and the ambience is great.  There are gas lamps at the booths, a beautiful upstairs and an outside courtyard."
0,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Fox E.,5 star rating,"If you are the lock, I have the KEY"
1,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Rick H.,5 star rating,"This is a landmark in Cleveland. If you're near Ohio City and want taste of Cleveland stop in.  Oh, you'd better be hungry. I had the Salisbury steak with mashed potatoes and corn. The gravy is traditional Salisbury hearty gravy. I also had a salad and bread. "
2,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Kathy M.,5 star rating,"I've always wanted to go, but the line was always so long. I got lucky and the wait wasn't that bad. "
3,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Eric D.,4 star rating,I have tried to eat here for  a few years now.  And today I finally did get to eat here. The line to get in was about 30 mins long.  Not bad compared to over an hour  every other time. 
4,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Karina G.,5 star rating,"Perfect, from the food to the service. "
5,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Amanda M.,4 star rating,This place a little intimidating for your first time. You basically get in line and order you food cafeteria style. Portions are huge. They have many menus hanging as you wait in line. So you have plenty of time to decide before you order. Each meal comes with a side and salad bar. I will say I was a bit disappointed in the chicken paprikas but everything else as really good. 
6,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Adrianna U.,5 star rating,"I love places like this. Once you step in, you really get a sense of an older time of Cleveland, where polish men would be arguing over their drinks at the bar, surrounded by sports memorabilia and other polish trinkets."
7,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Josh I.,4 star rating,8/10 
8,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Juli K.,4 star rating,"We were on vacation in Ohio for the NFL Hall of Fame enshrinement festivities and spent a day in Cleveland doing all the things.  Based on numerous Food Network shout outs and our love of pierogies, we sought out Sokolowski's."
9,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Cecilia M.,5 star rating,"Cafeteria style eatery. It's different in a great way. Although we were starving and had to make our way through the narrow space to the end of the line, everything moved like clock work. It gave you ample opportunity to look at all the great food as you walked by. It starts with plates of salad that you can choose, second cakes and afterwards different types of polish food. Let's go over some of the food: Cod Fish, Lake Erie both beer battered, potato pancake Reuben, mashed potatoes, macaroni and yes pierogis. So many more items that I don't remember all of it. They are well known for their Salisbury Steak. Oh!! STUFFED CABBAGE!! Also, and of course, must have sauerkraut and kielbasa with two different types of kielbasa's. It's a family owned and operated establishment. You have your experienced older generation Eastern European cooks. "
10,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Teresa C.,5 star rating,Fantastic!
11,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Adam C.,4 star rating,"Sokolowski's is a fun Hungarian joint in an industrial neighborhood south of downtown Cleveland. They serve up a large variety of Eastern European favorites in a cafeteria setting. The have a small beer list, a bar area, and a comfortable dining room with live music on the weekends. "
12,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Cory C.,4 star rating,"The line wrapped all around the building when we arrived, which I think is typical.  Thankfully, it goes by relatively quickly.  It's cafeteria style, so you have to grab a tray and utensils.  There is a lot of variety to choose from and everything that I had was delicious!"
13,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Carter D.,4 star rating,"I have been once before. We came into he Friday before Christmas at lunch hour with a party of six. The line was wrapped all the way to the second entrance and took us about 50 minutes to get through. I was prepared for a wait but not that long, I got dizzy with hunger lol they should pass out rolls in line or something! Ha at least there is plenty of unique items to look at while waiting in line and always a table ready for you when it's your turn. "
14,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Tiffany O.,4 star rating,"Always make a reservation here if you can. That's what I've learned from coming here multiple times. Sometimes you might even get screwed over by having a reservation, but at least you have one, and they will accommodate you as best as they can, even if they have a lousy excuse for screwing you over."
15,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Sheena W.,5 star rating,"Stopped in during the week around noon to grab some goods. Busy, but the line is worth it!"
16,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Leena J.,5 star rating,So glad we popped in here for lunch. I wanted to try the pierogi's but the stuffed cabbage stole the show! Absolutely delicious place to dine! We went in for lunch and enjoy the specials. It is set up cafeteria style. Lots of options- sweet peoples and lots of celebrities seem to enjoy this ace as well (pictures on the wall) check then when you are in Cleveland.
17,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Harish V.,4 star rating,Ticked off from my cleveland bucket list but definitely not worth waiting in line for an hour.
18,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Steve G.,4 star rating,This place just feels nostalgic which heightens the experience. Cafeteria style line with the option to order off a menu and have the food delivered to your table. I chose the menu and ordered a Reuben. The sandwich was good but nothing I'd be rushing back for. The staff was very friendly and gave out of town guests some free perogis to try since they had never had any. If I was rating based on my food alone it would have been three stars but add in the nostalgia and the staff and it bumps it to four. 
19,Sokolowski’s University Inn,"1201 University RdCleveland, OH 44113",Marissa S.,5 star rating,Oh Sokolowski's you are truly a gem & a Cleveland staple. I mean can you really say you're from Cleveland if you haven't been?
0,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Sarah F.,5 star rating,"Fantastic! First of all, they are taking MANY pandemic precautions. You order inside for takeaway or to eat on their ""patio."" The patio is certainly a humble little covered space in a parking lot. Charge of $2 per person for eating in which covers a bottle of water and all disposable tableware and lysol wipes."
1,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Cassandra A.,5 star rating,Highly recommend! It was my first time there. I ordered take out. Unfortunately due to what is taking place they didn't have the Shanghai meatball and that looked yummy! If I lived closer I would go often.
2,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Samantha K.,5 star rating,"The food here was so delicious. We had a pork and vegetable wonton soup (large enough for 2 plus leftovers), soup dumplings, sticky rice, and Shanghai beef flat noodles. Every dish was so delicious and the staff here was so friendly (we switched our order from take out to eat in twice due to miscommunication between me and my husband). It was so fresh and so delicious. They have a house recipe vinegar sauce and that poured over the sticky rice was so utterly delicious. We are already planning a return. They do not have inside dining but have a great back patio to eat there or get it to go. They do charge $2 for eating there to cover the cost of measures taken currently but you do get a bottle of water, access to all eating utensils as you need, plus that amazing house made vinegar sauce. Eat here. It is amazing and you leave feeling so happy. Also, they have parking in the back!!"
3,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Vy D.,3 star rating,We came here because the reviews looked great and there were soup dumplings. We were interested and it was our first time here.
4,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Emily C.,5 star rating,"I'm usually not a huge fan of Asian cuisine but this place  knocked it out of the park! We ordered the pan fried beef noodles, the pan fried noodles, and the soup dumplings. Everything was so fresh and tasty. I can be pickier with meat, and the meat on the noodle dish was definitely high quality. "
5,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Ashley G.,5 star rating,This was an absolute delight!! I enjoyed every flavor and would fly/drive to this place. I definitely recommend whatever you want to try.
6,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Agnes I.,5 star rating,"It doesn't look like much when you walk pass this restaurant outside but the food will leave you begging for more. I'm so glad that I finally visited LJ Shanghai on the last Friday of January 2020. My friend and fellow Yelp Elite, Christina P. joined me."
7,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",W L.,5 star rating,"We dropped by during a road trip. Had the Shanghai soup dumplings, shrimp and pork wonton soup and Beef Chow Fun. It was all good!"
8,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Stephen M.,5 star rating,Show up wIth your whole party in tact to be seated right away... 
9,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Julia T.,5 star rating,Loved this place! Cute and homey and the service was great. Very attentive without being overbearing. I went with a friend and we really enjoyed our food! I got the soup dumplings and the spicy chaoshou while my friend got the vegetarian pan fried noodles. We were very impressed with the flavor and quality of the food! 
10,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Dana W.,5 star rating,"The atmosphere is casual and the staff is friendly.  This review may be a bit odd, because I don't eat Chinese food  but I'm a good friend that accompanies my crew with more adventurous pallets!  "
11,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Areej K.,5 star rating,"I love this place and I'm so thankful that they are open during Covid. The quality of the food is always consistent, fresh and full of flavor!! My absolute favorite item is the Shanghai pan fried flat noodles, best noodles I have ever had!!! And today I tried the Spicy Chaoshou, amazing tender wonton in an outstanding chili oil sauce!! This place has to be the best noodle shop in the US, no doubt about it."
12,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Mindy Y.,3 star rating,"As someone who speaks Cantonese, I always appreciate walking into an establishment in which the folks speak the same language as me. So I was expecting some amazing food. Food was good - I ordered the Chong Qing Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, which was pretty spicy (don't be like me and wear a white shirt because all that redness is going to splatter on your shirt as you slurp the noodles). We also ordered some Xiaolongbao, which the owner asked us right after we sat down whether or not we want some (maybe it took some time to steam). The wrapping is a little thick, but juiciness is on point. I also ordered some spicy wontons (which they almost forgot), and that was ok. "
13,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Sheena W.,5 star rating,Stopped in the other day with friends and had a really tasty meal! 
14,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Dana H.,5 star rating,"Yum yum yum! I am dreaming til I can come back to this place again!!! I kept seeing the yummy noodles and dumplings on yelp, and once I was finally there it was all I could dream of and more. I ordered off of the trusty method of looking at menu pictures and it didn't lead me astray. The portions were perfect and there plenty more options you'll want to try the next time you stop by!"
15,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Lisa S.,5 star rating,"We went for the soup dumpling, we'll go back for the pan fried noodle. Hands down winner of our lunch. Bok choy, cabbage, chewy noodles. Bang."
16,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Kiki K.,4 star rating,I'd give this spot a 4.5. The service was nice. Ambiance a little boring. Food menu is super limited so I really wouldn't recommend this spot for vegetarians. 
17,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Kyle L.,5 star rating,"We were on a road trip passing by Cleveland, and glad to find this amazing restaurant. Friendly staff, fresh ingredients, and refreshing dishes. I want to point out that a lot Chinese dishes rely on supporting ingredients that are not necessarily eaten ( e.g., cilantro, scallion, garlic), unlike other Chinese restaurants, this one is very generous on those, which made their dishes very authentic."
18,LJ Shanghai,"3142 Superior AveCleveland, OH 44114",Eric T.,5 star rating,"So it's COVID era, but my boy the Ethiopian Lion has made his return to Cleveland. I decided to pay him a calculated visit. I had wanted Siam Cafe, but the Lion tells me he had a better spot. He told me about this new spot that was definitely a hidden gem. I was down. So this place is definitely a hole in the wall. The owner was super friendly and service was quick. With things being how they are, there were a few items unavailable. We were both hungry so we balled out. An order of seaweed salad, sweet and spicy ribs, braised duck, two orders of the chao shou (basically wontons in chili oil), and the beef pan fried noodles (beef ho fun). So the seaweed salad was full of flavor. I've had some that taste like they're out of a can. The ribs were good...tender and the sauce wasn't overwhelming. The braised duck was delicious as well. The sauce was sweet and savory without being too salty. The duck was tender. The chao shou was one of my favorites. The chili oil wasn't too overwhelming. Not too spicy. The pork inside was tender. My only critique may have been I wish there was a little more pork inside. The beef noodles though were bomb. Thick cuts of tender beef. The rice noodles were thinner than what I usually see, but they held their shape well. The soup dumplings were good, but I'll be honest, I've had better. The skin was a touch too thick for my taste but the soup was hot and the meat was tender. I think the soup could've been just a touch more savory. All in all, this is a place I would highly recommend."

The building was old, but the people were extra friendly, and service was very good. The waitress explained a few food items to us. The lunch menu is mostly noodle bowls with and without meat. The dumplings looked good coming out in bamboo baskets. Each meal is freshly made, so we asked for no salt. Hubby who has been in Shanghai probably 500 tImes, said he felt like he was in the city. The food was delicious. Bathrooms were extra clean. Parking is along the street."

They are taking a lot of precautions related to COVID so we felt safe. They took our temperature at the door, had markings on the floor to keep everyone distanced, had hand sanitizer available, kept the tables distanced, wore masks and required masks, and kept most parties outside if possible. I was very impressed with their precautions. "

Since they just reopened after the covid19 shutdown we were asked if it was okay to have our temperature taken at the door. We were offered hand sanitizer and thanked for wearing a mask. It was a beautiful evening so we sat on the most beautiful patio in all of Cleveland. Tables were spaced well and we never thought for one minute that anyone was too close.

16,Fat Cats,"2061 W 10th StCleveland, OH 44113",Rena S.,5 star rating,"We love this place, especially their happy hour menu. We've tried many items on the menu, but the Pancit, Ban Bao steamed buns, macaroni and cheese, lumpia, and crispy chicken sandwich are all amazing. They used to have a melted cheese sandwich on their menu with tilamook cheddar and siciliano bread that was the best grilled cheese I've ever tasted. Every time we go, I ask for it, and even though it's not on their menu anymore, they are always willing to still make it for me. Their fries are delicious and skinny - almost like a haystack, and perfectly seasoned. You really can't go wrong with anything here but I would recommend reservations if you're going at a busy time, especially if it's cold outside. This place fills up quick and parking is quite limited."

0,Mia Bella Restaurant,"12200 Mayfield RdCleveland, OH 44106",Amy T.,5 star rating,"The best Italian food meal ever! We chose to eat outside, only 2 tables outside during COVID. Luckily we scored 1. While waiting for our food, we recieved fresh, soft bread with herbed butter. So yummy. I ordered eggplant parmesan. Afterwards I overheard the waitress tell the next table that the eggplant is cut nice and thin to make it extra crispy. Just how I like it. My boyfriend ordered appetizers. Caprese salad, roasted peppers, green salad, polenta, and pork belly. Everything was so good, but as he was eating the pork belly, he started,  ""It's so good, I want to cry."" I've never heard him say this before!!! Definitely eat here!"

The food had so much flavor, was well balanced and I appreciated the use of fresh herbs and effort to make the pasta from scratch. The outdoor seating is lovely and the service was spot on. I've been to Italy many times and Mia Bella actually reminded me of Italian (not American Italian) food. I highly recommend dining here.

5,Mia Bella Restaurant,"12200 Mayfield RdCleveland, OH 44106",Wende' F.,3 star rating,"We came on a Saturday night for dinner and it was very busy. They do take reservations but outside seating is first come, first serve. There is limited seating outside, but it's nice and on a chilly evening there are heaters. The staff is following COVID guidelines. They have face shields rather than masks. I ordered the chicken risotto. The dish was beautiful but the risotto desperately needed a dash of salt. We were able to enjoy our meal with wine-they have a great menu. Overall the food, drinks, and atmosphere was okay and I would return."
6,Mia Bella Restaurant,"12200 Mayfield RdCleveland, OH 44106",Angela G.,5 star rating,My mom and I had the best dinner here Saturday evening. We made reservations ahead of time to sit inside because you can't make reservations for outside. We put our name in to request outside as soon as we got there and waited awhile for an outdoor table but it was worth it! I love the atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk. Reminds me of actually being in Italy.

Very glad we did; excellent Italian food and well timed service. Good wine list as well. Loved the eggplant parm, offered as an appetizer but just the right amount for a lighter dinner. The bolognase was also excellent. Some thick cut, yummy warm Italian bread with herbed butter arrived first thing on the table, which I always appreciate. The interior is nicely decorated and there were quite a few tables outside on the sidewalk. Located in the Little Italy section, just a short walk up the street brings you to a lovely gelato bar for espresso and dessert."

1,Slyman’s Restaurant,"3106 Saint Clair Ave NECleveland, OH 44114",Bilal M.,5 star rating,"Slyman's is truly a Cleveland classic. This place has been here for years and continues to set the standard for Cleveland deli's. The corned beef is cooked to perfection and thinly shaved in dramatic portions onto Swiss cheese on Rye bread and then grilled. The result--simply the best sandwich in Cleveland. Complemented with thousand island dressing or mustard to your preference. Have been here 5+ times now and they continue to be consistently excellent. Most recently went during Covid precautions and can honestly say that they haven't missed a beat. Food was still exceptional. Obviously, the dining room is closed and takeout only. However, everyone is wearing a mask and gloves. They take social distancing and sanitation very seriously which is a real breath of fresh air. Recommend 5 stars without hesitation. Will continue coming back for more!!"

The sandwiches are amazing, or maybe I should be giving credit to the corned beef. We have now even done a take out order, and that was delicious too."

Walked in on a Monday at 11:30 and the place was half full, but it filled up. It's not very big, and Patrons are served quickly. The carry-out area was very active. We ordered a grilled Reuben. It wasn't as big as I thought it were be. The sandwich was just right size to share. The corned beef was moist and tender. The sauerkraut was just enough and the toasted rye was delicious.  You squirt on the Thousand Island dressing yourself, or squirt it on bite by bite. The fries were home cut and crispy, and unsalted. I ordered a coffee to go. Parking is on the street or in their small lot. Credit cards are accepted."

I would love to more vegetables or sauerkraut in the Reuben. It was kinda overwhelming with the meat, but their meat was fresh and did not have any weird smell that cold meats tend to have. The bread was perfectly buttered.I'd love to try other dishes next time."

18,Slyman’s Restaurant,"3106 Saint Clair Ave NECleveland, OH 44114",Henry L.,5 star rating,"Hands down the best corned beef and reuben sandwich I've ever had. I was skeptical at first of a sandwich composed 95% of meat, but nothing about it got old as each bite was perfectly toasted, sliced, and packed with flavor - truly surprisingly balanced for how heavy of a flavor I was expecting. Friendly and quick service and love all the condiments that come on the table. Also recommend their wedding soup which was a great complement to the 2 giant sandwiches we got. Definitely lives up to its hype and is a place that has really perfected its craft."

2,Herb ‘n Twine,"4309 Lorain AveCleveland, OH 44113",Logan B.,1 star rating,"Seriously one of my favorite neighborhood spots I've been frequenting for years, but today put an end to all of that. I called 45 minutes ahead for 3 sandwiches and when I showed up, was told they just started making them and it would be a few minutes. Cool, no big deal. I have a real friendly back and forth with the girl at the register, leave a 20% tip, and go wait in my car."
3,Herb ‘n Twine,"4309 Lorain AveCleveland, OH 44113",Mark S.,5 star rating,"This hidden gem on Lorain and just around the corner was a great discovery. I've stopped by for the great sandwiches three times and was always happy I did. But don't take my word for it, HnT has limited availability and because of demand can run out of their great bread before the official closing time."
4,Herb ‘n Twine,"4309 Lorain AveCleveland, OH 44113",Reese D.,5 star rating,"Herb and Twine is one of those places you drive a little out of your way to go to. Thankfully for me I was able to hit it right when it opened before it got crazy (one of those ""we're out when we sell out"" places) and saddled up with a smoked turkey club."
5,Herb ‘n Twine,"4309 Lorain AveCleveland, OH 44113",Marissa S.,5 star rating,The turkey sandwich is a must have. Have nothing bad to say about this place besides that they tend to run out of bread really early and then close early so you have to really plan ahead. They should just make more bread. Make the people happy and make more delicious sandwiches!

7,Herb ‘n Twine,"4309 Lorain AveCleveland, OH 44113",Marty K.,5 star rating,"Probably my favorite restaurant in Cleveland since I discovered this place a few years ago. Talk about craftsmanship, you can tell the owners of this places pour every ounce of their creativity into the food they serve. The menu rotated every season or so and each time they manage to exceed expectations."

I ordered the Italian it was very very good and a kale Cesar salad everything was very fresh and made with care. I am so coming here many more times!!! Thanks so much !
9,Herb ‘n Twine,"4309 Lorain AveCleveland, OH 44113",Matthew Q.,1 star rating,"I have eaten here before and it was great.   Since then, the quality and taste of the food has gone down tremendously.  I can understand one bad meal but three in a row is a sign of a problem.  The staff was also rude the last time I was there."
10,Herb ‘n Twine,"4309 Lorain AveCleveland, OH 44113",Aleatha H.,5 star rating,"I had Herb 'n Twine bookmarked for a year. Finally had a chance to try and it definitely lived up to its hype! I tried the Prime Rib sandwich and it was heavenly! Now mind you, this sandwich had been sitting for hours before I had a chance to eat it. It did not matter, the sandwich was perfect when I finally got around to it. The bread itself should win an award, it is amazing. The beef was seasoned unlike most roast beef/prime rib sandwiches. The portion was hearty and the ingredients were top notch. You definitely get what you pay for! I can't wait to go back."
11,Herb ‘n Twine,"4309 Lorain AveCleveland, OH 44113",Wayne K.,5 star rating,"Best Sandwiches in CLE, hands down. Herb 'n Twine delivers the definition of artisanal sandwiches. Menu rotated often but the staples remain. You can't go wrong with the turkey club. Other favorites include the Italian and Chorizo Meatball subs."

I was very impressed with the sandwich selection. The decor is modern and rustic at the same time. There's street parking if you're lucky. Very generous portions!"
13,Herb ‘n Twine,"4309 Lorain AveCleveland, OH 44113",Zoe K.,5 star rating,"I am never dissatisfied with Herb 'n Twine!! Each time I visit I order a sandwich and the tomato bisque with extra of the blue cheese croutons (delightful!!). I enjoy the fact that their bread is freshly baked each day and their effort to use high quality ingredients. Their menu contains classic and unique sandwiches that are always delicious and I make an effort to try a new one each time I visit. The inside of the restaurant is also clean and provides some seating for those who are on a lunch break, although I have only ordered to-go. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a new lunch spot to try!"
14,Herb ‘n Twine,"4309 Lorain AveCleveland, OH 44113",Daniel W.,5 star rating,"One of my favorite sandwich shops in North America! Yeah I said it...The portions are huge, flavor combinations are complementary, and the bread is homemade/fresh. The homemade/fresh bread is such a game changer. My favorite is the Cubano...the perfect sandwich really. If there was a location in Chicago I would frequent weekly. "

18,Herb ‘n Twine,"4309 Lorain AveCleveland, OH 44113",Gina L.,5 star rating,"My husband and I went here for lunch to bring to the zoo this past Saturday. There is a limited menu of about ten sandwiches, two salads, and tomato bisque on their standard menu, that I believe they rotate through (according to my husband, a longtime devotee) but they have a special on the board as well. I got the special, which was a chicken sandwich with almond basil pesto, mozzarella cheese, bacon (got mine sans), mayo, and tomatoes. SOOOO good. Nice and warm and the chunks of chicken were huge. My husband got the grilled cheese, mostly because that was what I was eyeing as well, teehee, and it was awesome -- cheese and jam perfection."
19,Herb ‘n Twine,"4309 Lorain AveCleveland, OH 44113",Matt S.,5 star rating,"Well...what was said here about the prime rib sandwich was ABSOLUTELY TRUE!  It was amazing.  Tender, just the right amount of juice, meat loaded with flavor, and the bun didn't distract from the meat.  It came with a tasty pickle.  My wife had the Veggie Sandwich and for a lady who doesn't prefer beets, she enjoyed her sandwich.  They don't have fountain beverages but a cooler is fully stocked with Coke products, teas, water, and more.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating to our 'first-time visit' questions.  Not much seating so don't plan on eating and sitting around with friends; they need every table.  Before we left we decided to return and try other sandwiches.  Oh...the tomato soup was average, however, the croutons were AMAZING!"
0,Noble Beast Brewing,"1470 Lakeside Ave ECleveland, OH 44114",Angela G.,5 star rating,Favorite brewery I've been to in Cleveland so far honestly! I've seen the veggie sandwich on my Instagram feed for quite some time and I'm so happy I finally got to try it.
1,Noble Beast Brewing,"1470 Lakeside Ave ECleveland, OH 44114",Jackie C.,5 star rating,"Noble Beast is a staple for us- consistently good to great beers and the food is excellent. I fought the veggie sandwich (not literally... I refused to believe almond butter and aioli was a thing) but it's the best sandwich in town. Pre-COVID they typically had popcorn of some sort and it was always delicious although I have a particular love for the piggy popcorn (please bring it back someday). Most recently, I had the summer salad and it was also good- they just get flavors right here. "
2,Noble Beast Brewing,"1470 Lakeside Ave ECleveland, OH 44114",Taylor M.,5 star rating,"Let me tell ya, BIG FAN. I visited Noble Beast Brewing recently to catch up with some friends. I was impressed on a number of levels. 1) They had top notch COVID procedures. The tables were spaced well. The staff was great about maintaining distance, wearing masks and serving guests. At this time, walking up to the bar for ordering is not an option. And the bathrooms have a light up step peddle to limit one user in the whole bathroom at a time. Super unique and a great call in my option. 2) An amazing menu selection! Seriously, everything looked and sounded good. I personally got the pretzel and a Hazy Peach IPA. The honey mustard with the pretzel was very yummy and the IPA is definitely a new favorite. I'm a big hoppy fan, but the pairing with the peach mellows it out. But in a very good way. Come on beer people, back me up on this! 3) The NICEST staff. Enough said there. 4) Not to mention, the whole place is just adorable. You enter through a garage door to a fairly open concept despite the shape of the brewery. There's plenty of picnic table seating, high top options and it looked like there may have been a back patio too. There's plants dangling from the center of the brewery near the main bar. It's the perfect spot for gatherings or a small intimate setting too.  5) Good parking options! You're only human if you worry about parking like me. The meters out front are free after 6 p.m. and at a 2 hour limit prior."

4,Noble Beast Brewing,"1470 Lakeside Ave ECleveland, OH 44114",Jamie R.,4 star rating,Beer was delicious! I got the Greek chicken sandwich which was great too. Staff could be a little more attentive. Took quite a while for someone to come up to us.
5,Noble Beast Brewing,"1470 Lakeside Ave ECleveland, OH 44114",Amy M.,5 star rating,"Perfection! We went down the line and sampled every beer on tap. I have to say I enjoyed them all but my favorites were the Catchweight (Kolsch), the Styrian Wolf (IPA), and the Tiger Blood (Saison). Oh and the Evil Motives is FRICKIN WONDERFUL if you're an IPA fan (I'm usually not but Noble Beast may have changed my mind). "
6,Noble Beast Brewing,"1470 Lakeside Ave ECleveland, OH 44114",Crystal B.,4 star rating,"I ate here with my family for lunch. Everyone enjoyed what they ordered.

I'm so glad that I decided to stop in! I'm very wary lately with all thats going on, and they made me feel super safe like I was a part of the family that they actually care about!  Everything was perfect! Staff, food, drinks! I can't appreciate enough what they did for me and if I ever come through this way again, I will definitely make an effort to stop in and show love to this great establishment!"

The kielbasa corndog was fantastic and the family got the Cuban sandwich and were not disappointed. My only complaint would be that's it's too far from my house to come everyday!! brewfest and food nicely done! The Hazy peach IPA I had was delicious.

This local pub is run by locals who have what it takes to being one of the best breweries in Downtown Cleveland. This hip establishment is located in the heart of Downtown and fit for anyone. Don't expect to book a reservation, just show up, seat yourselves and order anything from the menu at the bar. Everything from the kitchen is made from scratch and equally compliments any beer."

Nice atmosphere and tasty food. Their Evil Motives IPA, for those IPA lovers, is very good and for those I'm the lighter side of drinks, try the Sour Rasberry Grissette with Sprite.

19,Noble Beast Brewing,"1470 Lakeside Ave ECleveland, OH 44114",Mary D.,5 star rating,"Love this place for both the beer and the atmosphere. During quarantine, it's still good for the  beer plus delicious takeout! We got the Bill's Turkey Sandwich with slaw and an order of the special wings. We were initially disappointed by the size of the wings, but we quickly forgot all about that once we took the first bite. On Wednesdays they do a wing special - this Wednesday it was cherry rub with brown sugar glazed ham crumble and shiso-ginger saison pickled pineapple - YEAH. So anyway, they were good and we were happy."
